# A* Implementation in Minecraft
This is a simple A* Implementation in Minecraft, intended for use with Forge. I made this around a year ago but decided to upload it now.
This was intended for use with a 1.8.9 forge mod - you have to register AStarTravelCommand as a command and a listener.

# How do I use this?
Do /travel (x) (y) (z) and it will send your player flying in the calculated route.
Please do not use this to cheat in multiplayer games. I intend this as educational material for other coders.
This can't be compiled standalone anyways.
